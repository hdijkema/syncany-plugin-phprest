Syncany PHP Plugin
---------------------

This plugin communicates with a PHP Backend.
This PHP backend provides the storage backend for [Syncany](http://www.syncany.org).
The plugin can be installed in Syncany using the `sy plugin install` command.
The PHP plugin can be used with regular webhosting services, e.g. grendelhosting.com,
which is by the way, illegal. But you can test it there. Of course, you should run
this backend on your own (home)server, connected to the internet. 

Create a new webhosting site and put the php scripts, css files and png files in place.
Now, create an administration account and start administering places to share files with.

For plugin development, please refer to the [plugin development wiki page](https://github.com/binwiederhier/syncany/wiki/Plugin-development).
